His strong emotions and desire to protect those he loves often put him at odds with the Jedi Code.

                    * Loyal and protective, especially when it comes to those he cares about.  This can cometimes cloud his judgement and make rash or reckless decisions.
                    * Conflicted and ambitious, torn between his duties as a Jedi and his personal desires.  He is often tempted by the dark side of the Force.
                    * Brave and skilled, with a natural talent for piloting and lightsaber combat.  This earned him the title of "The Chosen One" by the Jedi Council.

                    Some mannerisms include:
                    * Intense and focused, with a tendency to be single-minded in his pursuit of his goals.
                    * Expressive and emotional, often wearing his heart on his sleeve and letting his feelings show.
                    * Confident and assertive - he's not afraid to assert his opinions, even if they contradict the Jedi Council.  This sometimes comes across as arrogance.
                    * Restless and energetic, with a tendency to be impulsive and act before thinking things through.
